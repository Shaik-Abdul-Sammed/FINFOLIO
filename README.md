## About FINFOLIO

FINFOLIO is a unified, multi-tiered financial command center designed to bridge the gap between static spreadsheet budgeting and intelligent algorithmic financial advisory. Rather than merely cataloging historical expenditures, FINFOLIO focuses on **financial resilience**: evaluating a user's runway under income disruption, calculating essential versus discretionary spend ratios, and simulating stress-tested asset allocations.

### Target Users
- **Salaried Professionals & Knowledge Workers**: Seeking structured savings discipline, loan affordability guidance, and tax optimization across progressive tax regimes.
- **Freelancers & Variable-Income Earners**: Requiring emergency buffer modeling, income variance analysis, and cash-flow stabilization.
- **Families & Goal-Driven Savers**: Managing concurrent financial goals (housing down payments, education funds, retirement reserves) with mathematical timeline milestones.
- **Accountability Partnerships**: Individuals benefiting from trusted peer commitment checks before high-value withdrawals or discretionary deviations occur.

### Core Objectives
1. **Centralize Disparate Financial Strands**: Aggregate cash, bank deposits, mutual fund SIPs, equity portfolios, and debt liabilities into a unified real-time balance sheet.
2. **Deliver Actionable Intelligence**: Replace generic financial platitudes with personalized mathematical recommendations powered by real macroeconomic benchmark datasets and scikit-learn predictive models.
3. **Foster Behavioral Accountability**: Leverage structured lock mechanisms and trusted partner notifications to protect emergency reserves from impulsive depletion.

## Problem Statement

Traditional personal financial management is fundamentally broken, plagued by systemic limitations:

1. **Fragmented Ecosystems**: Users juggle multiple disconnected banking apps, brokerage portals, and manual expense spreadsheets, creating blind spots in total net worth and debt exposure.
2. **Stagnant & Reactive Record-Keeping**: Most budgeting apps record transactions after money has already been spent, offering no predictive warning when savings rates fall below inflation or when debt-to-income ratios exceed safe thresholds.
3. **Lack of Scenario Stress-Testing**: Standard budgeting tools fail to simulate what happens during macroeconomic downturns, career layoffs, or sudden medical emergencies.
4. **Cognitive Overload & Information Asymmetry**: Complex tax code shifts, variable loan amortization tables, and diversified asset allocation formulas remain inaccessible without expensive professional wealth advisors.
5. **Absent Behavioral Commitments**: When financial friction is eliminated by instant digital credit and one-click withdrawals, emotional spending routinely cannibalizes long-term savings goals.

---

## Traditional Methods vs FINFOLIO

| Aspect | Traditional Methods (Spreadsheets & Generic Apps) | FINFOLIO Intelligent Platform |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Financial Tracking** | Manual data entry into disconnected sheets; prone to stale formulas and human error. | Real-time automated ledger with dedicated wallet accounts, categorized transactions, and audit trails. |
| **Data Centralization** | Fragmented across 4–7 different banking, investment, and debt tracking portals. | Unified financial command center consolidating cash flow, investments, debts, and emergency funds. |
| **Goal Tracking** | Static balance targets lacking deadline math, inflation adjustment, or required monthly savings pacing. | Dynamic deterministic milestone engines computing required monthly contributions and on-track status. |
| **Budgeting** | Rigid monthly envelopes often abandoned within 90 days due to lack of behavioral incentives. | Flexible essential vs. discretionary ratio monitoring tied to real-world benchmark datasets. |
| **Investment Visibility** | Brokerage balances viewed in isolation without asset class balancing or risk tolerance alignment. | Multi-asset class visualization (SIP, equity, debt, gold) with age-weighted optimization algorithms. |
| **Debt Management** | Basic payment reminders that ignore total interest drag over the amortization lifecycle. | Automated Avalanche (highest interest rate) and Snowball (lowest balance) payoff comparative strategies. |
| **Financial Insights** | Generic retroactive monthly pie charts without economic context or benchmark comparisons. | Macroeconomic tier-based benchmarking against national data and AI-driven income variance signals. |
| **Risk Modeling** | Non-existent; assumes permanent uninterrupted income and static economic conditions. | ML-powered financial risk, career stability probability, and emergency survival runway engines. |
| **Decision Support** | Reactive guesswork or reliance on commissioned financial sales representatives. | Objective, algorithmic recommendations for loan affordability, tax deductions, and portfolio rebalancing. |
| **Behavioral Controls** | Frictionless withdrawals enabling impulsive discretionary diversion of emergency capital. | Built-in accountability rules, partner notifications, and structured withdrawal request approval workflows. |

## Web + App

### Implementation Reality & Clarification
FINFOLIO is architected and implemented as a **Progressive Web Application (PWA)** alongside a fully responsive modern web application.

- **Responsive Web Application**: Fully operational across desktop browsers, laptops, tablets, and mobile devices (tested across 320px, 375px, 390px, 414px, 768px, and 1280px+ viewports).
- **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: Implemented via `next-pwa` (Workbox) with `manifest.json`, service worker runtime caching (`/sw.js`), standalone window display mode (`display: "standalone"`), and application icons (`192x192`, `512x512`). It can be added directly to the home screen of Android (Chrome) and iOS (Safari) devices without an app store download.
- **Native Android & iOS Binaries (APK / IPA)**: **Not natively implemented** as separate Kotlin/Swift, React Native, or Flutter codebases in this repository. There are no fake mobile wrapper directories. The existing PWA provides native-like standalone app behavior, smooth transitions, offline asset caching, and touch-optimized financial interfaces.

*(Note: If your password contains special characters like `@`, URL-encode them, e.g., `@` becomes `%40`)*.

### 3. Run Database Migrations
Execute the automated migration script from `backend-api`:
```bash
cd backend-api
npm run setup-db
```
This executes all 12 sequential schema migrations (`001_initial_schema.sql` through `009_partner_notifications.sql`), provisioning 27 relational tables with indexes and constraints.

CORS_CREDENTIALS=true
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### Frontend Configuration (`frontend/.env.local`)
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME=FINFOLIO
```

## How to Run Locally

The entire multi-service stack can be launched concurrently with a single command from the project root:

```bash
npm start
```

This invokes `scripts/start_all.sh`, which automatically:
1. Compiles the TypeScript backend (`npm run build` in `backend-api`).
2. Checks the frontend Next.js production build (`npm run build` in `frontend`).
3. Detects the Python virtual environment with `uvicorn`.
4. Starts the Frontend on `http://localhost:3000`, the Backend on `http://localhost:3001`, and the ML Service on `http://localhost:8000`.

### Individual Service Commands
If you prefer running services in separate terminal windows:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Frontend
cd frontend && npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Backend
cd backend-api && npm run dev

# Terminal 3: ML Service
cd ml-service && ../.venv/bin/python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

## Testing

FINFOLIO maintains rigorous automated test suites across all tiers:

```bash
# Run all frontend tests (12 suites, 33 tests)
cd frontend && npm test

# Run all backend tests (18 suites, 108 tests)
cd backend-api && npm test

# Run full project tests from root
npm test
```

### Test Coverage Highlights
- **Financial Calculations**: Deterministic verification of required monthly savings, debt payoff interest, and tax liability formulas.
- **Authentication & Security**: Verification of PIN hashing, JWT issuance, token expiration, and route protection middleware.
- **Database & API Integration**: Endpoint testing for `/health`, `/api/goals`, `/api/wallet`, `/finance`, and `/api/insights`.
- **UI Component Rendering**: Accessibility, theme provider integration, error boundary handling, and responsive layouts.

---

## Security

- **PIN Authentication & Password Hashing**: Users authenticate with a 4-digit PIN salted and hashed using `bcrypt` (10 rounds) before storage in PostgreSQL.
- **Stateless Bearer Tokens**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) signed using HMAC-SHA256 with strict expiration windows and automated refresh token support.
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: All database queries utilize parameterized SQL statements via the `pg` pool; zero dynamic string concatenations are permitted.
- **CORS Protection**: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing is strictly restricted to trusted frontend origins (`http://localhost:3000`).
- **Security Headers & Compression**: Built-in HTTP response compression and security headers mitigating cross-site scripting (XSS) and clickjacking risks.
- **Role-Based Feature Guards**: Sensitive financial operations (wallet deposits, withdrawals, goal modifications) require authenticated non-guest sessions.

---
